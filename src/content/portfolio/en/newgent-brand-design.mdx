What's a company without a brand? When I started my freelance design company, Newgent Digital, in 2022, I created a complete brand design kit to represent the company visually going forward.

This included a logo, colour palette, fonts, and other graphic elements that can be used in various contexts, such as on websites, business cards, social media and marketing materials.

The logo is simple and modern, featuring a combination of an icon and text with the company name. The colour palette consists of a primary colour (blue) and several secondary colours (navy blue, white and black) that complement each other.

The font has been chosen to be easily readable and professional, with a sans-serif style that works well for digital media.
