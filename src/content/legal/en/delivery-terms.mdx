These delivery terms (the "Terms") describe the processes and conditions for the delivery of services and products from HallinMedia ("we", "us", "our"). By ordering our services, you accept these terms.

## Delivery Forms and Times

For digital products and services, we apply different delivery times depending on the nature of the service. Photographs, video, and graphic materials are delivered via secure download link within 7-14 working days after production or approved concept.

All projects follow an agreed project plan with clear milestones, whilst consulting services are delivered according to a schedule adapted to project requirements. For digital products, delivery occurs immediately after payment confirmation.

## Delivery Process

### Confirmation and Communication

We value clear and proactive communication throughout the delivery process. After each order, we send an order confirmation within 24 hours.

During the delivery process, we keep you updated about the project status through regular written updates. Should any delays or need for changes arise, we inform you immediately so that you always have full insight into the process status.

### Quality Control

To ensure the highest possible quality, all our services undergo comprehensive quality control before delivery. This includes verification against order specifications to guarantee that all requirements are met, as well as technical compatibility checks for digital deliveries. 

Our quality control follows established industry standards and ensures that each delivery meets or exceeds expectations.

## Delivery Prerequisites

### Customer Responsibilities

For a smooth delivery process, it is important that you as a customer provide correct and complete delivery details. You also need to be available for any necessary approvals during the process and provide all necessary materials within agreed timeframes. 

For digital deliverables, it is your responsibility to ensure technical compatibility with your systems.

### Our Responsibilities

We commit to delivering according to agreed specifications and schedules, and to proactively communicate any deviations in good time. We ensure quality and security in every delivery and provide technical support when needed.

Our support also includes assistance with any technical issues that may arise in connection with the delivery.

## Delays and Deviations

### Handling of Delays

If a delay occurs, we will inform you immediately about the cause and present a new estimated delivery time. In some cases, compensation may be provided according to special agreement.

For significant delays that substantially affect you, you have the right to cancel the purchase according to applicable consumer legislation.

### Force Majeure

We cannot be held responsible for delays caused by circumstances beyond our control, such as natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, strikes or other labour market conflicts, war or acts of terrorism, and technical problems outside our sphere of control.

## Delivery Costs

For standard deliveries of digital material, there are normally no additional costs. However, if you desire express delivery or require special technical solutions, additional fees may apply. We always inform you about any extra costs in advance.

## Reception and Approval

### Delivery Approval

Upon receiving the delivery, it is important that you carefully check that everything matches your order. Any errors or deficiencies should be reported to us within 7 days of receipt. 

### Claims

If you discover any errors in the delivery, please contact us immediately via delivery@hallin.media. Include a detailed description of the error to help us handle the matter efficiently. 

## Special Delivery Terms

### Business Customers

For our business customers, we offer the possibility of customised delivery processes that can be tailored to specific needs.

This may include special terms according to framework agreements and the assignment of a dedicated contact person for all delivery-related matters.

## Changes to Delivery Terms
