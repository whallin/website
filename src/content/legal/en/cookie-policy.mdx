This Cookie Policy explains what cookies and similar technologies are, how we use them on www.hallin.media, and how you can manage them. It keeps the essential legal points but is presented in a shorter, consolidated form with subheadings for readability.

## What cookies are and why we use them

Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. We use them to make the site work, remember your preferences, improve performance, analyse usage, and deliver relevant content and advertising.

## Categories of cookies we use

### Essential
Required for the website to function (session management, security, saving your cookie choices). These cannot be switched off in our systems, though you can block them in your browser (some features may stop working).

### Functional
Enable enhanced features such as language or theme preferences. Blocking these may degrade your experience.

### Analytics & third-party services
Used to measure site use and performance. We rely on a mix of first-and third-party analytics and monitoring services, some of which may set cookies or collect data when you visit our site.

These services include Umami, Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, Cloudflare Analytics, Apollo.io, PostHog and Sentry. Each provider has its own privacy policy (see links below).

### Marketing & social
Used to personalise advertising and to enable social media features. Marketing cookies may be set by partners such as HubSpot and by social platforms when you interact with sharing features.

## How long cookies last

Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain until they expire or you delete them; lifespans vary by cookie and provider.

## Managing your choices

When you first visit the site you'll see a cookie notice where you can choose which categories to allow. You can change these choices at any time via the `Cookie Settings` link in the footer or by adjusting your browser settings (blocking or deleting cookies). Browser controls:

- `Google Chrome`: Settings > Privacy and Security > Cookies and other site data
- `Mozilla Firefox`: Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data
- `Safari`: Settings > Privacy > Cookies and website data
- `Microsoft Edge`: Settings > Cookies and site permissions

We use a cookie management system designed to support GDPR and ePrivacy compliance; it lists cookies and lets you change categories.

## International transfers and safeguards

Data collected via cookies may be transferred outside the UK/EEA. Where that happens we implement appropriate safeguards required by applicable data protection law. See our [Privacy Policy](/en/legal/privacy-policy) for details about transfer mechanisms.
