These Terms of Service ("Terms") apply to services and products provided by HallinMedia ("Provider", "we", "us") and to use of the website www.hallin.media ("Website"). By using our services or the Website you accept these Terms. Consumer rights under applicable law remain unaffected.

## Key Definitions

- **Services:** All products and services provided by the Provider.
- **Customer:** The natural or legal person contracting with the Provider.
- **Consumer:** A natural person acting primarily outside business operations.
- **Business Customer:** A legal entity or person acting within business operations.

## Scope, Services & Website Use

- **Service scope:** We provide design, photography, video, marketing, branding and consulting; specific engagements may include additional terms.
- **Website use:** Use the Website lawfully; you must not overload, attack, or attempt unauthorised access to systems or distribute malicious code.

## Ordering, Delivery & Changes

- **Agreement formation:** Orders and assignments become binding upon our written confirmation or signed agreement.
- **Delivery & delays:** Stated delivery times are indicative unless expressly agreed; we will notify significant delays.
- **Changes:** Changes must be agreed in writing and may affect price and timing.

## Price, Invoicing & Refunds

- **Prices:** Shown excluding VAT unless stated; consumer prices include VAT. Quotes valid for 30 days unless specified.
- **Additional work:** Charged at agreed rates or by separate agreement.
- **Payment:** Standard terms: 30 days net (business) or 14 days net (consumers), unless otherwise agreed; advance payment may be required for certain services.
- **Late payment:** Default interest, reminder fees and collection costs may apply.
- **Refunds & adjustments:** Refunds are limited to undelivered services; price changes are notified 30 days in advance and do not affect existing contracts.

## Intellectual Property & Third-party Material

- **Ownership:** We retain copyright and ownership of created materials until full payment, after which agreed usage rights transfer per the engagement.
- **Source files:** Source and working files remain our property unless expressly agreed otherwise.
- **Customer materials:** The Customer warrants third-party materials (texts, images, logos) do not infringe rights and indemnifies us for claims arising from them.
- **Provider materials:** We will use properly licensed third-party material for assignments.
- **Portfolio use:** We may include delivered work in our portfolio and marketing unless otherwise agreed.

## Liability, Claims & Force Majeure

- **Standard of performance:** We perform services professionally and are liable for negligence or breaches of agreed services.
- **Limitation of liability:** Liability is limited to direct damage up to the amount paid for the relevant service; we are not liable for indirect or consequential losses (e.g., lost profit).
- **Customer obligations:** Customers must provide accurate information and timely materials and are responsible for approvals once given.
- **Claims:** Defects must be reported in writing within 14 days of delivery; we shall be given a reasonable opportunity to remedy valid claims (repair, re-deliver, or price reduction).
- **Force majeure:** We are not liable for delays or failures caused by events outside our control; delivery times may be extended accordingly.

## Confidentiality & Data Protection

- **Confidentiality:** Both parties shall keep confidential information secret during the contract and for three years thereafter, except information that is public, previously known, or lawfully obtained from third parties.
- **Personal data:** We process personal data in accordance with applicable law (including GDPR). See our [Privacy Policy](/en/legal/privacy-policy) for details. Where we process personal data on behalf of a Customer, a data processing agreement will be used.

## Termination & Consequences

- **Duration:** Agreements end on delivery and payment unless an ongoing service specifies a term. Ongoing agreements renew automatically in three-month periods unless timely terminated.
- **Early termination:** Either party may terminate for material breach after a 30‑day cure period; a Customer who terminates without cause compensates for performed work and reasonable costs.
- **After termination:** Customers pay for services provided to termination date; confidential materials are returned and license rights remain as agreed for paid work.

## Dispute Resolution & Governing Law

- **Governing law:** Swedish law applies.
- **Resolution:** Parties shall seek to resolve disputes by negotiation, then mediation where appropriate. Consumers may bring disputes to general courts or the General Complaints Board (ARN). Business disputes are finally resolved by arbitration seated in Skellefteå, in Swedish, unless otherwise agreed.

- **Entire agreement:** These Terms together with engagement documents form the complete agreement.
- **Severability:** Invalid provisions are replaced by valid ones that closely reflect the original intent; the remainder remains in force.
